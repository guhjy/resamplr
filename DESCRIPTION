Description: Provides functions that implement resampling methods,
  including the bootstrap, jackknife, random test/train sets,
  k-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out and leave-p-out cross-validation,
  time-series cross validation, time-series k-fold cross validation,
  permutations, rolling windows. These functions generate data frames
  with `resample` objects that work with the modelling pipeline of `modelr`
  and the `tidyverse`.
